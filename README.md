# Machine-Learning-Project-Predicting-Weight-Classification-with-Pyspark
Here, we are working with survey data involving the physical characteristics and lifestyle choices of a number of individuals. 
The goal of this study is to analyse what factors are most connected to obesity and develop a model that can predict an individual's weight classification as accurately as possible. 
It is important to note that due to weight classification. being defined throught the lens of BMI, Weight and Height will provide the most accurate model. 
However, we will attempt to design a model witout these two most influential factors to find the best model for Weight Classification.
